'''

This is a simple protection tool against evil twin attack.

the idea is to preform a scan over an interface network trrafic.
by logic this tool checks if traffic was recived from more than one mac address, under the same SSID (Name)
if so, it alerts the user. 


    Each SSID can use specific authentication and encryption settings,
     enabling you to configure differing levels of security for different resources.
    By default, the authentication/encryption is set to none.
